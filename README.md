## 3D Convolution
# Objective
The purpose of this lab is to implement a 3D convolution using constant memory for the kernel and 3D shared memory tiling.

## Prerequisite Before starting this lab, make sure that:

- You have completed the “Tiled Matrix Multiplication” MP

- You have completed all week 4 videos

# Instructions
- Edit the code to implement a 3D convolution with a 3x3x3 kernel in constant memory and a 3D shared-memory tiling.

- Edit the code to launch the kernel you implemented. The function should launch 3D CUDA grid and blocks, where each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output.

- Answer the questions found in the questions tab.

## Algorithm Specification
You will be implementing the following 3D convolution.
```
for z_out = 0 to z_size - 1:
  for y_out = 0 to y_size - 1:
    for x_out = 0 to x_size - 1: {
      let res = 0;
      for z_mask = - MASK_RADIUS to MASK_RADIUS:
        for y_mask = - MASK_RADIUS to MASK_RADIUS:
          for x_mask = - MASK_RADIUS to MASK_RADIUS:
            let z_in = z_out +  z_mask;
            let y_in = y_out + y_mask;
            let x_in = x_out + x_mask;
            // Pad boundary with 0
            if (z_in >= 0 && z_in < z_size &&
                y_in >= 0 && y_in < y_size &&
                x_in >= 0 && x_in < x_size) then
               res += mask[z_mask + MASK_RADIUS][y_mask + MASK_RADIUS][x_mask + MASK_RADIUS] * in[z_in][y_in][x_in]
           }
      out[z_out][y_out][x_out] = res;
    }
 ```
- The kernel size is fixed to 3x3x3, given MASK_WIDTH = 3 and MASK_RADIUS = 1.
- Halo elements should be read as 0.
- You should support input data of any size.
- Note that the input and output size is the same.
## Other Notes
- The raw format of the input data is a flattened array, where the first three elements are the z_size, y_size, and x_size respectively. For example, a 5x4x3 input array will look like

- float inputData[] = { 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, ... < 60 floats > }
- A point (z,y,x) may be accessed at z * (y_size * x_size) + y * (x_size) + x.

- The template code reads the first three elements into z_size, y_size, and x_size. You will need to copy the rest of the data to the device.

- Likewise, the result needs to have the sizes prepended for WebGPU to check your result correctly. The template code does that as well, but you must copy the data into outputData from the fourth element on.

- Remember that you can get a pointer to the fourth element of the array with &arry[3].
